# hog

Implementation of a simulator (with multiple strategies) for the dice game Hog, where two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice outcomes.
